Spike the basic scraping of the EE account page in python?

Language choice for full implementation:
Stay in python if that works?
Java would be easy given familiarity but feels heavyweight if I'm paying for the .
Go - interesting from a learning perspective but not a sane choice for the use case.
Scala, same problems as Java, no clear advantages I'm aware of.

Platform:
GCP? Cheap, interesting to play with a new Platform
Azure: Same as GCP?
AWS: Known quantity
other?

Logging, graphing, monitoring and alerting:
Good time to try out logging Saas systems? Try loggly, then try greylog (open source, need to host)
Graphing, ELK stack?  Saas system?
monitoring
